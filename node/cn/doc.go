Package cn implements components related to network management and message handling.
CN implements the Klaytn consensus node service.
ProtocolManager handles the messages from the peer nodes and manages its peers.
Peer is the interface used for peer nodes and has two different kinds of implementation
depending on single or multi channel usage.
