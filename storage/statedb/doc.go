Package statedb implements the Merkle Patricia Trie structure used for state object trie.
This package is used to read/write data from/to the state object trie.

Overview of statedb package

There are 3 key struct in this package: Trie, SecureTire and Database.

Trie struct represents a Merkle Patricia Trie.

SecureTrie is a basically same as Trie but it wraps a trie with key hashing.
In a SecureTrie, all access operations hash the key using keccak256.
This prevents calling code from creating long chains of nodes that increase the access time.

Database is an intermediate write layer between the trie data structures and
the disk database. The aim is to accumulate trie writes in-memory and only
periodically flush a couple tries to disk, garbage collecting the remainder.
